# Enigma

One of my favorite project when taking CS61B: Data Structures in Java in Spring 2020. The project is based on the Enigma machines that Germany used during World War II to encrypt its military communications, and recreating a simulation of the generalized version of the machine. I grew my understanding of reciprocal algorithms, a crucial trait with and without data, such as understanding customer perspective with behavorial economics and game theory.
